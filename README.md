# Debugging maze game

As you can see from the gif, this game has some bugs.

To run the game for yourself, simply execute the `mazeGame.js` file.

Use the tickets on the board you copied to direct you to the bugs you need to address.

Also! Feel free to alter the map.js file if you need to create minimal reproducible examples. It's not the only way, but it could be a helpful one.
